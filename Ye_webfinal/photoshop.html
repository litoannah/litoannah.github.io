				<h1>Personal Selfie</h1>
					
				<p> Photoshop was the first Adobe program I used in this class. This experience was new to me, so I was not sure if I was heading the right direction when creating the raster project. I had difficulties trying to make the collage of images look natural while merged together, but I was able to manage it which turned out pretty well. </p>
