				<p> Making this animation was difficult because sometimes Iâ€™d hit a brick wall on how to make my animation flow naturally and it took time for me to figure out how I wanted it to look like. This was the first time I made a animation and I enjoyed it although it was time consuming and challenging; I was able to learn something new. </p>
